## Description
The "alx-gcc-examples" repository serves as a learning resource for understanding the basics of GCC and its usage in compiling C programs. It includes a collection of examples and exercises that demonstrate different aspects of using GCC for code compilation.

## Getting Started
To get started with the examples in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```shell
   $ git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-gcc-examples.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```shell
   $ cd alx-gcc-examples
   ```

3. Install GCC if it's not already installed on your system. Refer to the official GCC documentation for installation instructions specific to your operating system.

4. Open a terminal and navigate to the specific example directory you want to explore.

5. Review the source code file(s) and any accompanying files or documentation present in the example directory.

## Usage
To compile a C program using GCC, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the C source code file.

2. Use the following command to compile the program:
   ```shell
   $ gcc -o output-file-name source-file.c
   ```
   Replace `output-file-name` with the desired name for the compiled output file, and `source-file.c` with the name of your C source code file.

3. If the compilation is successful and no errors occur, an executable file with the specified output file name will be generated in the current directory.

4. Run the compiled program using the following command:
   ```shell
   $ ./output-file-name
   ```
   Replace `output-file-name` with the actual name of the compiled output file.

Please refer to the specific example's README or documentation for any additional instructions or requirements.
