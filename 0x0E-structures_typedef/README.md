Structures in C are user-defined data types that allow you to group together related data of different types into a single unit. They provide a way to create complex data structures that can represent real-world objects or concepts. Structures enable you to organize and manipulate data more effectively.

You would typically use structures when you need to store and manipulate multiple related data elements as a single entity. For example, if you want to represent a person with attributes like name, age, and address, you can define a structure to hold these attributes together.

To define a structure, you use the `struct` keyword followed by a name for the structure and a list of member variables inside curly braces. Here's an example:

```c
struct person {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float height;
};
```

You can then create variables of this structure type and access its members using the dot operator. Here's an example:

```c
struct person john;
strcpy(john.name, "John Smith");
john.age = 25;
john.height = 1.75;
```

You can also use `typedef` to create a new name (alias) for a structure type. This can make your code more readable and provide abstraction. Here's an example:

```c
typedef struct {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float height;
} Person;
```

Now you can directly use `Person` as the type instead of `struct person`. For example:

```c
Person john;
strcpy(john.name, "John Smith");
john.age = 25;
john.height = 1.75;
```

Using `typedef` with structures can simplify your code and make it more concise, especially when dealing with complex data structures or when you want to hide implementation details.

Structures are widely used in C programming to represent various entities such as records, objects, configurations, etc. They provide a way to organize and manipulate related data, making code more modular and maintainable.
