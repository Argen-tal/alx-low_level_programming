# Extra Singly Linked List Project

## Introduction
This project is an implementation of a singly linked list data structure. A singly linked list is a fundamental data structure that consists of a series of nodes, each containing data and a reference to the next node in the list.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a basic implementation of a singly linked list in Python. It serves as a learning exercise to understand the inner workings of a linked list and how to manipulate its elements.

## Getting Started
To use this project, you can follow these steps:
1. Clone or download the project files from the repository.
2. Import the necessary modules or classes into your Python script or interactive shell.
3. Utilize the provided methods to interact with the singly linked list.

## How to Use
The project provides the following functionalities for interacting with the singly linked list:

- Creation of an empty linked list
- Insertion of nodes at the beginning, end, or at a specific position in the list
- Deletion of nodes from the list
- Searching for a specific value in the list
- Retrieval of the length of the list
- Displaying the contents of the list
- Checking if the list is empty
