Function pointers are variables that store addresses of functions in C and C++ programming languages. They allow functions to be treated as data and provide a way to invoke functions indirectly.

The syntax for declaring a function pointer is as follows:
```c
return_type (*pointer_name)(parameter_list);
```

Here's an example declaration of a function pointer:
```c
int (*sum_ptr)(int, int);
```

In the example above, `sum_ptr` is a function pointer that can point to a function that takes two `int` parameters and returns an `int`.

To assign a function to a function pointer, you can simply use the name of the function without parentheses, as functions decay into pointers to their entry points in most contexts. Here's an example:
```c
int sum(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int (*sum_ptr)(int, int);
    sum_ptr = sum;  // Assigning the address of the function 'sum' to the function pointer 'sum_ptr'
    int result = sum_ptr(2, 3);  // Invoking the function through the function pointer
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the function pointer `sum_ptr` is assigned the address of the function `sum`, and then the function is invoked using the function pointer.

A function pointer holds the memory address of the function it points to. It points to the entry point of the function in memory, which is usually the starting address of the function's machine code instructions.

In terms of virtual memory, the exact location where a function pointer points to depends on the specific platform, compiler, and linker being used. Function pointers typically point to the executable code section of the virtual memory, where the compiled code of the function resides. The specific details of the memory layout are handled by the operating system and the executable file format.

It's important to note that function pointers are a low-level feature and should be used with caution. They can be powerful tools in certain situations, such as implementing callbacks, function dispatching, or dynamic runtime behavior. However, incorrect usage of function pointers can lead to bugs, security vulnerabilities, and hard-to-maintain code.
